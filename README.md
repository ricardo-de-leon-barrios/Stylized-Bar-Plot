This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that can be used to create bar plots with the special style seen in this image.

The user can write the data in the form of a list and this code will automatically create a bar plot as a vector image (SVG format). For this, it uses the *drawSvg* library to create the geometrical shapes such as circles and rectangles used for the bar plot, as well as the text. The Notebook allows the user to change parameters such as the text font, text size, style (italic, bold or normal) and the color used as the basic shade for the bars. It also allows the user to download the plot as an SVG or a PNG.

This code was an order requested from a client on Fiverr.
